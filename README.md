learning how to create a repository for code 


  My name is ephraimgate
     
  I am trying to learn github to use as a repository for stuff I want to make using python.
  I also would like to work on some cool open source projects. Doing
  the training that is available via online
  
  Going to build a profile and also explore some projects
  
  this is the second field test to see if I remember how a new branch works
  Since I am about to learn how to program, will continue to use this as a  writing 
  platform first and then move into something that is project orientated 
  
  to show chris github
  
  Testing a difference on this.
